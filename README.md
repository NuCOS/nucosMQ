# nucosMQ
*nucosMQ* is a python messaging module (in the sense of zeroMQ) written in pure Python. We are aware of other projects like *snakeMQ* but we were not able to produce 
reasonable results with that, since we depend in our related projects on massive threading.

The underlying protocoll is *tcp* and as an alternative *udp* yet not very far implemented. The Communication is **thread safe**, so it may be used 
together with whatever GUI-Library. The module is light-weighted, pure python and ready to use.

The project is in alpha stage: every usage is on your own risk and responsibility. 

*nucosMQ* implements two kind of connections: server-client connection and link-connection. The server accepts many clients, the link is a one-to-one connection.
The connections may be established also with your individual authentification method, which can be integrated easily (see examples). 

A publish/subscribe logic is implemented, where clients can subscribe to a topic and the server acts as a broker for that topology.
